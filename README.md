# Breakfastplaner
a little Breakfastplaner for a company, to avoid trouble between the colleagues

the main parts of the programm are, at the moment:
  - Breakfastplaner.py 
    - for Tests you can aktivate the while Loop at the bottom of the code
    - the Plan function should distribute the foods over the people for the Plan
    - the whole code was programmed before i used PyQt5 
    - I still need to work on the distributionsystem for the big Plan
  - firstwindow.py
    - is ther first window of the Programm, it switchs to another Window by using the "Person anlegen" Button 
      (linked to personlistwindow.py) and by pushing the "Plan anlegen" Button you can seee an Output in the console 
  - Breakfastplan.db, is just the DB where all the Data is safed
  
  the other programms are just for me to test code and play a little bit around
